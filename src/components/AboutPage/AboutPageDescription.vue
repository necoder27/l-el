      hey there! my name is <span class="text-nowrap underline decoration-gray-500"><strong>Laetitia El Badry</strong></span> and i'm a soon-to-be artificial intelligence student at johannes kepler university linz.
      prior to my pursuit of a bachelor's degree i graduated from the bilingual (german, english) class of the
      computer science department at htl spengergasse.<sup><a href="#footnoteHTL" class="text-gray-500">[1]</a></sup>
      after finishing school i started studying computer science at the technical university of vienna but after completing a few courses i
      made the decision to specialise in ai by switching university.
      i enjoy coding all kinds of things and like exploring and learning. however, my special interests lie in ai and frontend development.

      1. htl stands for "h&ouml;here technische lehranstalt" ("higher technical education institute") in german. it refers
      to a special form of high school that requires five years of study and the completion of additional technical
      and engineering focused subjects.
