      hey, welcome to my page! my name is Laetitia Fanni El Badry. i am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in
      computer science at the technical university of vienna, austria. prior to my enrollment, i was a student at htl
      <sup><a href="#footnoteHTL" class="text-gray-500">[1]</a></sup> spengergasse, graduating from the bilingual class of the computer
      science department.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not only have i been able to find enjoyment in programming and
      playing around with technical gadgets, i am also passionate about music. singing in a choir, taking opera singing
      lessons, and learning to play the flute have all been important parts of my life so far.

      1. htl stands for "h&ouml;here technische lehranstalt" ("higher technical education institute") in german. it refers
      to a special form of high school that requires five years of study and the completion of additional technical
      and engineering focused subjects.
